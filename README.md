# StatusNeo Visitor Management System
This repo maintains all the code built for a homegrown StatusNeo VMS.
Older Android app code is moved to [android](./android) folder and is unused for now.
A full stack Java backend web app code is present in the VMS folder and under active development. Check the [README](./web-backend/README.md) for details on that application.
