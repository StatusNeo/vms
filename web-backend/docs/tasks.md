3. [x] Strengthen SSL configuration with proper certificate management
4. [ ] Implement proper input validation across all endpoints
5. [ ] Add rate limiting for sensitive endpoints (login, OTP verification)
6. [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration
7. [ ] Add security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
8. [ ] Implement proper password hashing for any user credentials
9. [ ] Conduct a security audit and penetration testing

28. [ ] Consider using DTOs to separate API contracts from entity models
29. [ ] Implement proper cascade operations for entity relationships
30. [ ] Review and optimize database schema

## Performance Optimizations

32. [ ] Optimize database queries and add proper indexing
33. [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
34. [ ] Configure connection pooling properly
35. [ ] Optimize JPA/Hibernate configurations
37. [ ] Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks
39. [ ] Implement proper resource cleanup

## Testing Improvements

41. [ ] Increase unit test coverage

46. [ ] Implement continuous integration with automated testing
47. [ ] Add mutation testing to verify test quality
48. [ ] Implement contract testing for API endpoints
49. [ ] Add security testing (OWASP ZAP, etc.)
50. [ ] Implement proper mocking for external dependencies

## Configuration Management

51. [x] Consolidate configuration (choose between application.properties and application.yml)
52. [ ] Implement environment-specific configurations (dev, test, prod)
53. [x] Externalize sensitive configuration to environment variables
54. [ ] Implement configuration validation on startup
55. [ ] Document all configuration properties
56. [ ] Remove redundant configuration
58. [ ] Add proper logging configuration
