# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for this project.

## What is an ADR?
An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## How to create a new ADR
1. Copy `adr-template.md` to a new file named `NNN-title-of-decision.md` (where NNN is the next available number).
2. Fill in each section of the template.
3. Commit the new ADR to version control.
