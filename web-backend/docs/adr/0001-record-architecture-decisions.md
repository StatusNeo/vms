# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Record architecture decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As the project grows, it becomes important to document architectural decisions to ensure that the reasoning behind key choices is preserved for current and future team members. This helps with onboarding, knowledge sharing, and maintaining consistency.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document important architectural decisions in this project. ADRs will be stored as Markdown files in the `docs/adr/` directory, following a simple template.

## Consequences
- All significant architectural decisions will be documented and versioned.
- Team members can easily review the history and rationale for decisions.
- Slight overhead in maintaining ADRs, but benefits outweigh the cost.

## Alternatives Considered
- Not documenting decisions: This would make it harder to understand why certain choices were made, especially as the team changes.
- Using a wiki or external tool: Keeping ADRs in the code repository ensures they are versioned with the code and easily accessible.
