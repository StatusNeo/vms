# Visitor Management System (VMS) Requirements

## Project Overview
The Visitor Management System (VMS) is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate the process of managing visitors in an organization. The system handles visitor registration, authentication, and tracking while providing a modern, user-friendly interface.

## System Architecture

### 1. Main Components/Modules

#### Backend Components
- **Visitor Management Module**
  - Handles visitor registration and profile management
  - Manages visitor data persistence
  - Implements visitor search and filtering

- **Authentication Module**
  - OTP-based email verification
  - Secure visitor registration process
  - Session management

- **Notification Module**
  - Email notifications for new visitors
  - OTP delivery system
  - Admin notifications

- **Reporting Module**
  - Excel report generation
  - Visitor statistics and analytics
  - Custom report generation

#### Frontend Components
- **Registration Interface**
  - Modern, responsive design using Tailwind CSS
  - HTMX for dynamic interactions
  - Form validation and error handling

- **Admin Dashboard**
  - Visitor management interface
  - Report generation tools
  - Search and filter capabilities

### 2. Project Structure

#### Backend Layer
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
  - `VisitorController`: Manages visitor-related operations
  - `EmployeeController`: Handles employee-related operations

- **Services**: Business logic implementation
  - `VisitService`: Manages visit-related operations
  - `EmailService`: Handles email communications
  - `OtpService`: Manages OTP generation and validation
  - `ExcelService`: Handles report generation

- **Models**: Data entities
  - `Visitor`: Visitor information
  - `Visit`: Visit details
  - `Employee`: Employee information

- **Repositories**: Data access layer
  - JPA repositories for database operations

#### Frontend Layer
- **Templates**: Server-side rendered views
  - HTML templates with Tailwind CSS
  - HTMX for dynamic updates

- **Static Assets**
  - Images and logos
  - CSS styles
  - JavaScript utilities

### 3. Primary User Flow

1. **Visitor Registration**
   - Visitor enters personal details (name, email, phone)
   - System validates input data
   - OTP is sent to visitor's email
   - Visitor verifies email with OTP
   - Registration is completed

2. **Visit Management**
   - Visitor selects employee to meet
   - System records visit details
   - Host is notified
   - Visit is tracked and logged

3. **Admin Operations**
   - View visitor history
   - Generate reports
   - Manage visitor data
   - Monitor active visits

### 4. Architectural Decisions

#### Notable Design Choices
1. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Email notifications are sent asynchronously
   - Report generation uses background processing
   - Improves system responsiveness

2. **Security Measures**
   - OTP-based email verification
   - Secure session management
   - Input validation and sanitization

3. **Modern Frontend Approach**
   - HTMX for dynamic updates without full page reloads
   - Tailwind CSS for responsive design
   - Progressive enhancement strategy

4. **Data Management**
   - JPA/Hibernate for ORM
   - Efficient database indexing
   - Proper relationship mapping between entities

5. **Scalability Considerations**
   - Modular service architecture
   - Separation of concerns
   - Extensible design for future features
